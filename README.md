# ModifiedVanLoonModelSims
 Numerical simulations of a modified version of van Loon's model of binocular rivalry. The modifications allows for assymetric modulation of model parameters in order to simulate effects of monocular deprivation. This work was submitted as a term paper for Computational Neuroscience NEUR603 at McGill University, Winter2015.
